* It is certain that Toures evolved from a non-sapient species of feathered dinosaurs.
* Dinosaur fossils, some heavily resembling Toures, are found throughout the island.
* It is possible that Toures were once native to the island, given the variety of biomes present.

* Some have brought about the possibility of Toures' existence being intentional.
* The most common form of this theory regards a deity creating the Toures as a form of "thinking life."
* The deity this theoretical act is most often attributed to is The Watchful Kemp, who is attested in both Huinic and Toural literature.
* The Watchful Kemp is believed to have created Toures by meshing together various substances in such a manner that it reached a state of life.
* A less common form of this theory states that Toures are nem-made, likely to prove that one kind of sapient life can bring forth another kind of sapient life.
* This explains the high diversity of Toures, but is easily put into question by a slew of artifacts seemingly predating a point where the Huinem could've made sapient life.
