An incubator-type game. Anthologic incubator system.

Put more normally, this is a "Metroidvania" platformer with multiple single-player campaigns taking place over the history of an island named Shell Island or Chel(l)onisla.

Mode or Campaign summaries (not all of which are implemented yet):

Allen - An office worker everymole from a workplace comedy cartoon finds himself on Shell Island and must explore this strange new world to try and find a way out.

Exile - A Toure (bird-person) exiled from the Corx tribe becomes a key factor in the Great Toure War between the factions of Glint and Val. More combat-oriented, with "operations" and "battles" that Exi can fight through. Other key characters include generals and commanders of the main factions, along with those considered historical figures by the time of Allen's arrival.

Pilot - A Lameni (shark-person) who wishes to be a great captain some day crash-lands on Shell Island and is utterly fascinated with its peculiarities. Although this campaign takes place in the near future relative to Allen's campaign (around 2077), the world has more of a nautical or aged style to it resembling Flapjack.

Telemachus Cormack "McCool" Wendell/Vendal - A human (!) media nerd who lives in an quirky city gone mad ("Subpar Urbia"). His goal is to become "cool", his definition of which varies as he learns from various experiences. Several of these experiences involve some sort of "crime" (the law of the city is very loose), usually a "takedown" job. The split between daily city life and the life of crime is played in full stylized 3D, with various weapons and tools to choose from and actions to take. Throughout McCool's campaign, a strange television network named Clarity Associate Broadcasting is explored, with "OPX" as a new star.

Sargasso/Addendum - The journey of a "Danger Force" commander named Sargasso and his mysterious savior Mordecai "Angel of Death" Malloy to an old supernature-infested city. Sargasso must make use of contraptions, the environment, and standard weaponry to ward off the various threats he faces. Inspired by the scrapped "Ravenholm" projects that were intended by Valve to follow Half-Life 2. Played as an interlude of McCool's campaign.

Gilbertha Beaumont/Insanely Witchcrafted - A young witch, theoretically tormented by spirits of concepts, attempts to solve the mysteries of a strange village tearing through a mountain range. Played as a point-and-click adventure game. One of the many stories on CAB, also played as an interlude of McCool's campaign.

The Crossover: An observation session of the second Great Toure War forced upon OPX by CAB. Protagonists from previous campaigns return and work together to try and end the war. The spirits of Shell Island (then known as Chellonisla) play an important role in this story.

Good Ol' Joe: A "true story" of an amphibious materials and construction worker. Think Lucian of Samosata.

Mor: The earliest story of the island, taking place around year zero and showing the plight of an alien as they try to recover their ship parts for an escape. You are not limited by time as you would be in Pikmin, but you don't have an army to guide for your efforts. In that case, think of Toejam and Earl instead.

Hop: The latest story of the island, taking place in the relative far future. You control a robotic rabbit with modular parts and get to witness the ruins of what once was. Don't worry, there's still life on the island; it's just not organic. More puzzling in navigation than some other campaigns.

Slam - A 3D fighting mode similar to Shrek Super Slam or Power Stone. Similar controls to McCool and Addendum. Matches can be played as Timed (the player responsible for the most Slams/KOs wins), Last Nem Standing/Stock (Players have a limited amount of stocks, and the last one standing wins), Gold Rush (Players drop energy of worth when attacked, and the player with the most worth at the end of the match wins), and Stamina (Players are limited to one stock, but can be taken out by stamina depletion).

Missions - Isolated short stories that can involve special challenges and/or conditions and often take place on a single map/scene. These might not be canon.
